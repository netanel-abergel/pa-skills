# Owner Briefing Skill

> ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE: `gog` CLI is broken on this server. All calendar access uses direct API via credentials.json. Gmail section is unavailable — skip it.

## Minimum Model
Any small model. Data collection is CLI-based. Formatting is simple.

---

## ⚡ Execution Architecture (Anti-Timeout)

Briefing is split into 2 parallel subagents. Never run all sections in a single LLM call.

| Subagent | Domain | Expected Time |
|---|---|---|
| SA-1 | Calendar events (Google Calendar API) | <15s |
| SA-2 | Open tasks (monday.com or tasks.md) | <10s |

### How to Run
```
1. Spawn SA-1 and SA-2 simultaneously (sessions_spawn, runtime=subagent, lightContext=true)
2. Wait for both to complete
3. Main agent merges results and formats the briefing
4. Send to owner via WhatsApp
```

### SA-1 Task Template — Calendar
```
Fetch today's Google Calendar events for netanelab@monday.com using direct API.
Credentials: /opt/ocana/openclaw/.gog/credentials.json (use owner account with refresh_token flow)
OAuth token URL: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
Calendar API: https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/netanelab%40monday.com/events
Time range: today 00:00–24:00 UTC
Return plain text list: "• HH:MM — Title (Xmin/Xh)" or "• No events today"
```

### SA-2 Task Template — Tasks
```
Read /opt/ocana/openclaw/workspace/memory/tasks.md
Filter: only open tasks ([ ] not [x])
Return plain text list: "• task name" or "• None — all clear!"
```

### On failure of any subagent
Send the briefing anyway — mark the failed section as "(unavailable)".
Never skip the whole briefing because one section failed.

---

## When to Send (Decision Rules)

- **Weekday (Mon–Fri):** Send at the scheduled time.
- **Weekend / holiday:** Skip unless owner explicitly requests it.
- **Owner is travelling:** Still send — adjust timezone in cron if needed.
- **Data source fails (calendar/email/tasks):** Send the briefing with that section marked "unavailable." Do NOT skip the whole briefing.

## Briefing Format

```
☀️ Good morning [Owner Name] — here's your day:

📅 TODAY'S MEETINGS
• 09:30 — Standup (30 min)
• 14:00 — 1:1 with [Person] (1h)

📬 EMAILS NEEDING ATTENTION
• [Sender] — "[Subject]"

✅ OPEN TASKS
• [Task from monday.com or memory]

⚠️ HEADS UP
• [Deadline, unusual item, etc.]

Have a great day! 🙌
```

## Step 1 — Get Today's Calendar Events

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Fetch today's calendar events via Google Calendar API (direct auth — gog CLI is broken)."""
import json, sys, requests
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta

CREDS_FILE = '/opt/ocana/openclaw/.gog/credentials.json'
CALENDAR_ID = 'netanelab@monday.com'

try:
    with open(CREDS_FILE) as f:
        creds = json.load(f)

    # Find owner account
    owner = next(a for a in creds['accounts'] if a['type'] == 'owner')

    # Get access token via refresh_token flow
    resp = requests.post('https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token', data={
        'client_id': owner['client_id'],
        'client_secret': owner['client_secret'],
        'refresh_token': owner['refresh_token'],
        'grant_type': 'refresh_token'
    })
    access_token = resp.json()['access_token']

    # Calculate today's time range (UTC)
    now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    today_start = now.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0).isoformat()
    today_end = (now.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + timedelta(days=1)).isoformat()

    # Fetch events
    r = requests.get(
        f'https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/netanelab%40monday.com/events',
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'},
        params={
            'timeMin': today_start,
            'timeMax': today_end,
            'singleEvents': 'true',
            'orderBy': 'startTime'
        }
    )
    events = r.json().get('items', [])

    print("📅 TODAY'S MEETINGS")
    if not events:
        print('• No events today')
    else:
        for e in events:
            start_dt = e.get('start', {}).get('dateTime', '')
            start = datetime.fromisoformat(start_dt).strftime('%H:%M') if start_dt else 'All day'
            end_dt = e.get('end', {}).get('dateTime', '')
            if start_dt and end_dt:
                delta = datetime.fromisoformat(end_dt) - datetime.fromisoformat(start_dt)
                mins = int(delta.total_seconds() / 60)
                dur = f"{mins // 60}h" if mins >= 60 else f"{mins}min"
            else:
                dur = ''
            title = e.get('summary', 'Untitled')
            line = f"• {start} — {title}"
            if dur:
                line += f" ({dur})"
            print(line)

except Exception as e:
    print("📅 TODAY'S MEETINGS")
    print('• (unavailable)')
```

---

## Step 2 — Get Urgent Emails

> ⚠️ Gmail via gog is also broken — skip or mark as unavailable. Use monday.com tasks section instead for open items.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# BROKEN: gog gmail is unavailable on this server — section will print as unavailable
# Fetch up to 5 unread emails from the last day
GOG_ACCOUNT=owner@company.com gog gmail search \
  'is:unread newer_than:1d' \
  --max 5 \
  2>/dev/null \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json

# Parse JSON, default to empty list on error
try:
    emails = json.loads(sys.stdin.read().strip() or '[]')
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    emails = []

print('📬 EMAILS NEEDING ATTENTION')

if not emails:
    print('• No urgent emails')
else:
    for e in emails:
        sender = e.get('from', 'Unknown')
        subject = e.get('subject', '(no subject)')
        print('•', sender, '—', '\"' + subject + '\"')
"
```

---

## Step 3 — Get Open Tasks (monday.com)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

TOKEN_FILE="$HOME/.credentials/monday-api-token.txt"

# If token is missing, skip this section gracefully
if [ ! -f "$TOKEN_FILE" ]; then
  echo "✅ OPEN TASKS"
  echo "• (monday.com token not configured — skipping)"
  exit 0
fi

MONDAY_TOKEN=$(cat "$TOKEN_FILE")
BOARD_ID="BOARD_ID"  # replace with actual board ID

# Fetch first 5 items from the board
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: $MONDAY_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"{ boards(ids: [$BOARD_ID]) { items_page(limit: 5) { items { name state } } } }\"}")

# Print open (non-done) items
echo "$RESPONSE" | python3 -c "
import sys, json

try:
    d = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())
    items = d['data']['boards'][0]['items_page']['items']
except (KeyError, IndexError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    print('✅ OPEN TASKS')
    print('• (could not fetch:', e, ')')
    sys.exit(0)

# Filter out completed items
open_items = [i for i in items if i.get('state') != 'done']

print('✅ OPEN TASKS')
if not open_items:
    print('• None — all clear!')
else:
    for item in open_items:
        print('•', item['name'])
"
```

---

## Step 4 — Assemble and Send the Briefing

Run Steps 1–3, save each output to a temp file, then combine:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Run each section and capture output
CALENDAR_SECTION=$(bash step1-calendar.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "📅 TODAY'S MEETINGS\n• (unavailable)")
EMAIL_SECTION=$(bash step2-email.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "📬 EMAILS NEEDING ATTENTION\n• (unavailable)")
TASKS_SECTION=$(bash step3-tasks.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "✅ OPEN TASKS\n• (unavailable)")

# Build the briefing message
BRIEFING="☀️ Good morning — here's your day:

$CALENDAR_SECTION

$EMAIL_SECTION

$TASKS_SECTION"

# Option A: Send via WhatsApp
openclaw message send --to OWNER_PHONE --message "$BRIEFING"

# Option B: Send via email
# GOG_ACCOUNT=owner@company.com gog gmail send \
#   --to owner@company.com \
#   --subject "☀️ Your Daily Briefing — $(date +'%A %B %d')" \
#   --body "$BRIEFING"
```

---

## Cron Schedule

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "morning-briefing",
      "schedule": "0 7 * * *",
      "timezone": "Asia/Jerusalem",
      "task": "Generate and send the owner's morning briefing: calendar events, urgent emails, and open tasks. Use owner-briefing skill.",
      "delivery": {
        "mode": "message",
        "channel": "whatsapp",
        "to": "OWNER_PHONE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- Runs daily at 07:00 in the owner's timezone.
- Change `"0 7"` to adjust time.
- Change `"timezone"` to match the owner's location.

---

## Customization Options

| Goal | Change |
|---|---|
| Only meetings after 9am | Filter events: `if start_hour >= 9` |
| Skip internal standups | Filter: `if 'standup' not in summary.lower()` |
| Add weather | Call weather skill before building briefing |
| Highlight flagged emails | Change search to `is:starred` or `is:important` |
| Evening summary (tomorrow preview) | Change `TODAY/TOMORROW` to tomorrow's dates |

---

## What NOT to Include

The briefing is for action, not recap. Apply this filter before sending:

- ❌ Don't recap things the owner already knows (decisions from yesterday, completed work)
- ❌ Don't list completed tasks from yesterday — they're done, move on
- ❌ Don't include calendar events more than 48h away — not actionable today
- ❌ Don't include low-priority emails that can wait (newsletters, FYIs, no-reply)
- ❌ Don't repeat the same item two days in a row if nothing changed
- ✅ **Rule: if it doesn't need action TODAY, leave it out**

A good briefing takes 30 seconds to read. If it's longer, cut more.

---

## Cost Tips

- **Very cheap:** Data collection is CLI-based — no LLM tokens for fetching.
- **Small model OK:** Formatting the briefing is simple — any model works.
- **Avoid:** Don't fetch 30 days of email history — search only `newer_than:1d`.
- **Batch:** Fetch calendar + email in one script run, not separate sessions.
- **On failure:** Send partial briefing — don't skip the whole thing.
